## Overview

This project is a backend service built using `Spring Boot` and `Java`. It exposes RESTful API endpoints for managing
resources in a `PostgreSQL database`. The application is containerized using `Docker`, enabling easy deployment and
scaling.

For Security of endpoints and app, This project implements `spring-security`. All endpoints (if required) are secured to
be accessed by only authentic users.

### Project Dependencies

- **Java**: `opne jdk: v22.0`.
- **Spring Boot**: `v3.3.3`.
- **PostgreSQL**: `v16.0`.
- **Docker**: with `docker-compose v3.0`.
- **Maven**: `v4.0.0`.

### Features

- RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations.
- User authentication and authorization.
- Integration with PostgreSQL for persistent storage.
- Dockerized application for easy deployment.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/abhijeet-Bh/job-pulse.git
   cd job-pulse
   ```

2. **Build the application:**

   ```shell
   mvn clean install
   ```

### Running the Application

You can run the application using `Maven` or `Docker`.

#### Running with Maven:

1. **Run the Spring Boot application:**

   ```shell
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

2. **Connect to the PostgreSQL database:**

   Ensure PostgreSQL is running and configured as per `application.properties`.

#### Running with Docker:

1. **Build and run the Docker containers:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command will start the Spring Boot application and PostgreSQL database in Docker containers.

## API Documentation

### Endpoints

Below are some example endpoints. Replace these with your actual API endpoints.

- **GET** `/job`: Retrieve all jobs.
- **GET** `/jobs/{jobId}`: Retrieve a single job by ID.
- **POST** `/jobs`: Create a new job.
- **PUT** `/jobs/{id}`: Update an existing job by ID.
- **DELETE** `/jobs/{id}`: Delete a job by ID.

### Example Request/Response

- **Request - `GET` `http://localhost:8080/job`:**
- **Response:**

  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "statusCode": 200,
    "data": [
        {
            "id": "95f25de1-a4a3-4b46-aecc-becc95f2456f",
            "title": "Software Engineer",
            "description": "Software Engineering Job, proficient in JAVA",
            "minSalary": "18 LPA",
            "maxSalary": "20 LPA",
            "location": "Hydrabad",
            "company": {
                "id": 1,
                "name": "Google Inc.",
                "description": "American Software Company.",
                "reviews": []
            }
        }
    ],
    "message": null
    }
  ```

## Database

### Schema

The database schema is managed by `Spring Data JPA`. Hereâ€™s an overview of the `jobs` tables:

- **Resources Table:**
    - `id` (Primary Key)
    - `title`
    - `description`
    - `minSalary`
    - `maxSalary`
    - `location`
    - `company`

Ensure the database configuration matches your `application.properties` or `application.yml` settings.

---

## Docker Setup

This project includes a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for easy setup.

### Dockerfile

The `Dockerfile` is used to build the Spring Boot application into a Docker image.

### Docker Compose

`docker-compose.yml` orchestrates the Spring Boot application and PostgreSQL database.

To run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will start both the application and the database, making the API accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
