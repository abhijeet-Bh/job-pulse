# RESTful API Backend Project (Job-site)

## Overview

This project is a backend service built using Spring Boot and Java. It exposes RESTful API endpoints for managing
resources in a PostgreSQL database. The application is containerized using Docker, enabling easy deployment and scaling.

## Tech Stack

- **Java**: Programming language used for backend logic.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the RESTful API.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for data storage.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform to run the application and database.

## Features

- RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations.
- User authentication and authorization.
- Integration with PostgreSQL for persistent storage.
- Dockerized application for easy deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java 17 or higher**
- **Maven 3.6 or higher**
- **Docker**
- **PostgreSQL (for local development without Docker)**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Build the application:**

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

### Running the Application

You can run the application using Maven or Docker.

#### Running with Maven:

1. **Run the Spring Boot application:**

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

2. **Connect to the PostgreSQL database:**

   Ensure PostgreSQL is running and configured as per `application.properties`.

#### Running with Docker:

1. **Build and run the Docker containers:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command will start the Spring Boot application and PostgreSQL database in Docker containers.

### Running Tests

Run the tests using Maven:

```bash
mvn test
```

## API Documentation

### Endpoints

Below are some example endpoints. Replace these with your actual API endpoints.

- **GET /api/v1/resources**: Retrieve all resources.
- **GET /api/v1/resources/{id}**: Retrieve a single resource by ID.
- **POST /api/v1/resources**: Create a new resource.
- **PUT /api/v1/resources/{id}**: Update an existing resource by ID.
- **DELETE /api/v1/resources/{id}**: Delete a resource by ID.

### Example Request/Response

- **Request (POST /api/v1/resources):**

  ```json
  {
    "name": "Sample Resource",
    "description": "This is a sample resource"
  }
  ```

- **Response:**

  ```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Sample Resource",
    "description": "This is a sample resource",
    "createdAt": "2024-08-15T12:34:56Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-08-15T12:34:56Z"
  }
  ```

## Database

### Schema

The database schema is managed by Spring Data JPA. Hereâ€™s an overview of the primary tables:

- **Resources Table:**
    - `id` (Primary Key)
    - `name`
    - `description`
    - `created_at`
    - `updated_at`

Ensure the database configuration matches your `application.properties` or `application.yml` settings.

## Docker Setup

This project includes a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for easy setup.

### Dockerfile

The `Dockerfile` is used to build the Spring Boot application into a Docker image.

### Docker Compose

`docker-compose.yml` orchestrates the Spring Boot application and PostgreSQL database.

To run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will start both the application and the database, making the API accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
